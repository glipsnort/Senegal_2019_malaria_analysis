# Senegal_2019_malaria_analysis
Key analysis scripts for paper analyzing 2019 falciparum data from Senegal ("Malaria surveillance reveals parasite relatedness, signatures of selection, and correlates of transmission across Senegal").

These scripts are quite specific to this dataset and the analysis in the paper and not at all pretty. They work from a vcf file containing the dataset and assume a directory structure with the following subdirectories under the directory containing the script: /data, /output, /seq, /results. They assume that whole genome sequence data is in a file named data/all.vcf.gz and that barcode data is in three files: data/Senegal_AllBarcodes_20200701.txt, data/mono_barcodes_filtered_2019.csv, and data/poly_barcodes_filtered_2019.csv. (These last three are included in this repository).
